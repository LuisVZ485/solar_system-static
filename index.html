                The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of 
                the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane. All eight planets have nearly 
                circular orbits that lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.

            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <p>
            
                Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that's
                inhabited by living things. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system,
                 it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
                  Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun,
                   all of which are made of rock and metal.

                The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth,
                 were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, 
                 which simply means “the ground.”
                <br>
                <br>
                With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets
                and the fifth largest planet overall.

                From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers),
                 Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
                 
                 It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun 
                 to reach our planet.

            <p>
            
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun - a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons,
                 polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.

                NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter 
                (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.

                Perseverance rover - the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world 
                - touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles 
                (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.

                Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab Emirates arrived on Feb.
                 9, 2021. China's Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an orbiter, a lander, and a rover. 
                 Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from orbit.

                In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land successfully on Mars when its Zhurong Mars rover touched down.

                An international fleet of eight orbiters is studying the Red Planet from above including three NASA orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey,
                 Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN.

                These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer,
                 with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

            <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <p>
            
                Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists - all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth.
                 That discovery changed the way we see the universe. 
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system -
                 more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

                Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. 
                Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

                One spacecraft - NASA's Juno orbiter - is currently exploring this giant world.
